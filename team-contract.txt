Goals
* Is it acceptable for one or two team members to do more work than the others in order to get the team an A?
No.
* What are the goals of the team?
Complete the project: we hope to do the required parts very well. 
If time permits, we can do the extensions.

Meeting and communication norms
* How will you use the in-class time?
Work on the project.
* Meetings outside of class
We plan to meet in-person probably more after iteration 0, most likely no more than 1-2 hours per meeting.
We will decide on as we go (i.e. every class meeting depending on our progress).
We will meet in a study room in the library or student center.

* How will you communicate outside of meetings? (Email list? Realtime messaging platform?)
Group chat via text.

* Updates
Once we finish a part, send updates in the group chat.

Work norms
* How will work be divided among team members? (Show how you filled in the boxes from the project handout.)
Iteration 0:
Puzzle ADT: Sabrina, Ronak
Parser: Emily, Ronak
Server: Emily, Sabrina 
Drawing: Emily, Sabrina
Client ADT: Emily, Ronak
Interaction: Sabrina, Ronak

Iteration 1:
Puzzle ADT: Emily
Parser: Sabrina
Server: Ronak
Drawing: Ronak
Client ADT: Sabrina
Interaction: Emily

* Internal deadlines
Our internal deadlines for the official ones for iteration 0 is before class time on that day.
Same applies for iteration 1.
We plan to finish the project by 5/9 (Thursday) at midnight so we have a one day buffer before the official deadline.

* Reviewing our work
Since we plan to finish the work by class time, we can code review during class.
People who work on one component for iteration 0 can talk with those who will work on it for iteration 1.
When we finish iteration 1, we will go over the work altogether.

* Where will you record who is responsible for which tasks? (Including future tasks that come up over the course of the project.)
Update the team contract.
